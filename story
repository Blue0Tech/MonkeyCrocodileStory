*Story*
Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the bank of a river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river, and rested under the tree.
The monkey offered him some fruits and the crocodile came back again the next day for some more fruits.
That's how the crocodile and monkey became friends.
