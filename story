*Story*
Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the bank of a river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river, and rested under the tree.
The monkey became greedy and wanted to make clothes out of the crocodile's skin.
The crocodile caught the monkey trying to do that and ate him.
